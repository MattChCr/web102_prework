# WEB102 Prework - *Sea Monster Website*

Submitted by: **Matthew Chavez Cruz**

**Sea Monster Website** is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total 

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [x] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [x] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [x] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

* [x] Changed the browser icon so the website's tab is easily identifiable.
* [x] Adjusted some of the colors on the website to be more appealing.
* [x] Changed the hover lightbox from affecting the stats-container to a single stats-card so the user
can follow along easier.
* [x] Added a navigation bar that scrolls with you, it allows users to go the top of the page, the stats
section or the games section regardless of where they are on the page.
* [x] Added the hover lightbox effect to the filtering buttons so users can more easily tell which one they are going to choose.
* [x] Added the amount remaining till the funding goal is reached when filtering for unfunded games.
* [x] Added live search bar to help users in finding a specific game.
* [x] Fixed issue where GAMES_JSON would always remain sorted (now when showing all games it matches the original order the page initially loaded).
* [x] Added interactive game titles on the game card - these would link to a site to either buy the game or to help fund it (currently the game's provided image is acting as a placeholder).
